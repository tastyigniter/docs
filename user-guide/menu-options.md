## Overview

This page allows you to `Create`, `Edit` and `Delete` options. We recommend that you have all the necessary information ready when making adjustments to the `Options` page.

Options can be any additional items, add-ons or extras which are available on your menu. 

For example, if you sell pizza an option can be `Toppings` and an option value would be `Pepperoni`.

On the other hand, if your restaurant sells set meals, an option can be `Sides` and an option value can be `Rice`.

How you determine what to set as option and option value is entirely up to you.

On this page, you can `Create`, `Delete` and `Edit` your options. The following attributes are visible on this page for each individual option item: `Name`, `Priority`, `Display Type`, and `ID`.
